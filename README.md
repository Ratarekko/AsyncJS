# This repository contains five asynchronous programming tasks in JavaScript

  Task 1
  * Choose array fn (map/filter/filterMap/some/find/findIndex)
  * Prepare its callback based async counterpart
  * Prepare demo cases for the usage
  * Add new on-demend feature during review
    e.g.: Add support for debounce (if the task took less then X time to
    complete -- add an additional execution delya)

  Task 2
  * Prepare promise based alternative
  * Write use cases for the promise based solution
  * Write use cases for the async-await
  * Add new on-demend feature during review
    e.g.: Add support for parallelism

  Note: for technologies that do not have the native Future-like async functionalities
  You may combine Task 1 and 2 into a single Task that will showcase the idiomatic way of handling concurrency.

  Task 3
  * Integrate AbortController or other Cancallable approach

  Task 4 (Stream/AsyncIterator/Alternative) -- Ongoing processing of large data sets that do not fit in memory

  Task 5 (Observable/EventEmitter/Alternative) -- Reactive message based communication between entities
